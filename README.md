The Body Mass Index (BMI) App is a simple tool designed to help you calculate your BMI, a measure of body fat based on your height and weight. 
This app provides a convenient way to monitor your health and track changes in your BMI over time.

Key Features:

BMI Calculation:

Input your height and weight, and the app will calculate your BMI automatically.
The app supports both metric (centimeters/kilograms) and imperial (inches/pounds) units for height and weight.
BMI Category Interpretation:

After calculating your BMI, the app will provide an interpretation of your BMI category, indicating whether you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese according to standard BMI ranges.
